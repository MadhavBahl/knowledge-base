# Dealing with procrastination on the tasks you are afraid of

Often, the reason for procrastination is the fact that we dread the task, either we feel that we aren't skilled enough, or we aren't confident enough.

Here are 7 ways in which you can deal with this type of procrastination.

ğŸ“Œ Accept and Learn
ğŸ‘‰ Acceptance is the first step towards improvement
ğŸ‘‰ Ask yourself, are you skilled/confident enough?
ğŸ‘‰ If the answer is no, reach out for help, study the topic a little before jumping on to the task

ğŸ“Œ Try Pomodoro
ğŸ‘‰ Divided your tasks into chunks
ğŸ‘‰ Work for 25 mins, rest for 5 mins
ğŸ‘‰ Repeat 3 iterations and take a long break

ğŸ“Œ Monitor Negative Thoughts
ğŸ‘‰ Recognize the pattern of thoughts that come just before you think of procrastinating
ğŸ‘‰ Beware of those thoughts, don't let them increase

ğŸ“Œ Put something at stake
ğŸ‘‰ We often procrastinate because we don't see any immediate gratification
ğŸ‘‰ If that's the reason, give some money to your friend
ğŸ‘‰ He returns that amount back to you only if you complete your task

ğŸ“Œ 15 Minute Greed
ğŸ‘‰ Often we overthink and the task appears more scarier than it actually is
ğŸ‘‰ Force yourself into doing that task
ğŸ‘‰ Tell yourself that do it for 15 mins, if it doesn't work out you will leave
ğŸ‘‰ Chances are, that you will find it's not that scary

ğŸ“Œ Think about long term value
ğŸ‘‰ Take a break
ğŸ‘‰ Think about how beneficial this task is going to be in the long term
ğŸ‘‰ Dream a little ğŸ˜‰

ğŸ“Œ Reward yourself
ğŸ‘‰ Set targets
ğŸ‘‰ Reward yourself if you achieve those goals
