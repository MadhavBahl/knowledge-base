# 3 Tips for increasing self-accountability

Being accountable is an absolute requirement to build trust.

Here are 3 tips to increase your self-accountability

ğŸ“Œ Find an accountability partner
ğŸ‘‰ Find someone whom you can tell your goals so that he can help you keep your commitments

ğŸ“Œ Make your goals public
ğŸ‘‰ Call it the fear of embarrassment, or anything else, but by putting your goals on social media, or telling them to a few people, you can increase your motivation to complete the work.

ğŸ“Œ Profit/Loss
ğŸ‘‰ Sometimes we procrastinate because of lack of sense of instant gratification (in other words, we feel that there's nothing on stake)
ğŸ‘‰ Put something on stake
ğŸ‘‰ Example: Give your friend some money, he returns it back to you only if you complete the task.
