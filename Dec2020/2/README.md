# The Power of Feedback

No matter what's the level of your skills, you can always make use of feedback,

ðŸ“Œ Leverage positive feedback to level up yourself from beginner to intermediate

ðŸ“Œ Leverage negative/constructive feedback to level up yourself from intermediate to expert

ðŸ“Œ Ignore the useless feedback,

And remember, feedback from one source is "Opinion", it can be correct or just a point of view,

True feedback can be known from multiple sources.
