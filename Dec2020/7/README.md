# Bonding Social Capital vs Bridging Social Capital

One mistake that almost all of us make ðŸ‘‡

We often tend to connect with people having same/similar interests, hobbies, goals, passion, or profession.

There are two categories when we talk about social capital

ðŸ“Œ The Bonding Capital
ðŸ’¥ Your relationships "within a group"

ðŸ“Œ The Bridging Capital
ðŸ’¥ Your relationships "between groups"

In short term, it's your bonding capital that might get you more opportunities/learning/growth,

But, in long term, having a good bridging capital is also essential to

ðŸ’¥ Broaden your perspective
ðŸ’¥ Open you to new opportunities
ðŸ’¥ Get a better understanding of the bigger picture

So, have a balance between both.

Remember, a good network is formed by a good balance between bonding social capital and bridging social capital.
