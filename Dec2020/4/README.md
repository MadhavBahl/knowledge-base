# 5 Steps for Achieving Ambitions

Have big dreams?

These 5 steps will help you -

ğŸ“Œ Recognize Priorities
ğŸ‘‰ Not every task contributes towards your ambitions
ğŸ‘‰ Identify the 20% of tasks that bring you 80% of the success
ğŸ‘‰ Differentiate "productive tasks" from "busy tasks"
ğŸ‘‰ Do these high priority tasks first, trying to do everything might make you end up doing nothing

ğŸ“Œ Set SMART Goals
ğŸ‘‰ Specific
ğŸ‘‰ Measurable
ğŸ‘‰ Attainable
ğŸ‘‰ Relevant
ğŸ‘‰ Time-Bound

ğŸ“Œ Make a plan or a roadmap
ğŸ‘‰ Clearly list down how you are going to proceed
ğŸ‘‰ Remember, failing to plan is planning to fail

ğŸ“Œ Focus on goals
ğŸ‘‰ When you work, keep aside the unproductive distractions
ğŸ‘‰ Try doing Deep Work

ğŸ“Œ Learn from the past and automate whatever possible
ğŸ‘‰ Not everything requires your time, but we learn it only after exploring
ğŸ‘‰ For the next iteration cycle of these steps, identify these tasks, and if possible automate them.
ğŸ‘‰ Your aim shouldn't just be reaching your goals, you should aim to reach your goals faster than before.
